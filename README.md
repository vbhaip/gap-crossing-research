# Gap-Crossing Video Analysis

This project presents a system comprised of two machine learning models to identify locations of gap-crossing events. The project them employs computer vision techniques to identify the center of mass and the direction of the fly during these gap-crossing events. The system achieves an optimal accuracy of 84% on identifying frames with attempts and is used to analyze the decision making processes of flies across various genotypes. The goal of this project is to apply this classification system to existing videos to gain meaningful analysis of different genotypes that affect decision-making processes in the fruit fly.


## Getting Started

This project uses Python 3.6. Install the packages in the requirements.txt file using

```
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
